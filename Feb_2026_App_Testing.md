# Feb 2026 App Testing Instructions

This document is for giving out instructions for Beta-testing the TCL Flip with sideloaded and custom software. It will also include space for feedback.

## Goal of this exercise

The goal of this exercise is to see which apps are worth having on the phone based on their ease of setup, ease of regular use, cost, and how much they will benefit users.

## Having Issues?

I will have daily office hours to deal with bugs/questions. Please wait until then so I can give issues my full attention!

## Using the Mouse

You will need to use a new built-in mouse to access many of the apps on here.

### How to use the mouse

- Hold down the STAR key (to the left of messages key) to activate/deactivate the mouse.
- Use DPAD and center key to navigate
- Use the volume Up/Down buttons to slow/speed up the mouse movement
- Press and hold the center key, plus the DPAD, to SCROLL the page. You will need this ability to navigate some of the apps!

## Apps to use

For each of the apps below:

- Try to setup yourself, using your own credentials
- Try using over the course of a week
- Come to **office hours** if you get stuck
- Fill out form at the end with your thoughts.

**if you get stuck on the app, follow the "how to use the mouse" instructions to get a handle on scrolling and navigating**

- Apple Music (requires mouse)
- OpenBubbles (requires mouse)
- WhatsApp (does not require Mouse)
- Uber (built-in mouse)
- Organic Maps (requires mouse)
- SyncCloud (requires mouse and is in "All Apps:)
  - This app syncs your icloud to your dumbphone. You'll need to generate an app-specific password for this app.

```
How to generate an app-specific password

1.	Sign in to https://appleid.apple.com.

2.	In the Sign-In and Security section, select App-Specific Passwords.

3.	Select Generate an app-specific password or select the Add button , then follow the steps on your screen.
